Siggraph is the world's largest conference in computer graphics and interactive techniques. Every year there are talks and panels and all that fun stuff that conferences have. What I find fun with Siggraph though is the technical papers, some of the latest research in computer graphics. So below here follows a list of the papers that I find interesting. The description is taken from the siggraph homepage since it is nice and short. For now, take a look at the technical papers preview!

Cool ey? Now here are the papers I have found interesting so far, in no particular order.

# A Multi-Scale Model for Simulating Liquid-Hair Interactions
A novel multi-component simulation framework that treats many of the key physical mechanisms governing the dynamics of wet hair. This approach yields an effective wet-hair simulator used to animate hair flipping, dog shaking, a spinning car wash roller brush dunked in water, and intricate hair coalescence effects.

# Bounding Proxies For Shape Approximation
A new bounding shape approximation algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary surface mesh, with potentially complex multi-component structures, and automatically generates a bounding proxy that is tightened on the input and can match even the coarsest levels of approximation, with application to simulation, freeform deformation, and LOD generation.

# A Practical Extension to Microfacet Theory for the Modeling Varying Iridescence
Introducing an extension to microfacet theory for rendering iridescent effects caused by thin films of varying thickness on top of an arbitrarily rough base layer. The material model is the first to produce a consistent appearance between tristimulus (RGB) and spectral rendering engines.

# Fluxed Animated Boundary Method
A novel approach to guiding physically based particle simulations via boundary conditions that uses a simple yet powerful primitive called a fluxed animated boundary, consisting of a control shape and a material flow field. The system takes care of enforcing the corresponding boundary conditions and necessary particle reseeding.

This work extends the concept of primary sample spaces into that of sampling charts, obtaining a new type of algorithm called charted Metropolis light transport, which can be seen as a bridge between primary sample space and path-space Metropolis light transport.

# Shader Components: Modular and High-Performance Shader Development
This paper demonstrates an approach for achieving both modularity and high performance for shader code in current and upcoming real-time rendering engines.

# Lighting Grid Hierarchy for Self-Illuminating Explosions
This paper presents an efficient method for rendering explosions with self-illumination and self-shadows by converting the volumetric lighting data into many point lights, and it introduces lighting-grid hierarchy as a novel solution to the many-lights problem that is temporally stable and provides superior performance by precomputing shadows.

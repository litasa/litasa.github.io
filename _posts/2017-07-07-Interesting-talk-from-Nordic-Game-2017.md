So I went to Nordic Game Conference this year (2017) and saw this talk in person. I found it super interesting, it shows how you can do something quite dynamic using simple physics. You get to see all the different stages involved in creating a character...

If you haven't played [INSIDE](http://store.steampowered.com/app/304430/INSIDE/) and are planning to play it <font color="red">[WARNING: SPOILERS IN VIDEO]</font>. Otherwise I very much recommend this talk.

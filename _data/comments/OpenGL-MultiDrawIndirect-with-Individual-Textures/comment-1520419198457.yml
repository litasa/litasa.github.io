  I can't believe this has no comments, since it's essentially the only
  practical example of how to use this that exists. Thank you so much for
  writing this! I'm having a little bit of trouble getting it to work on my end,
  but this post helped me get my implementation from not rendering at all to
  rendering incorrectly, which is a huge step.

My name is Jakob Törmä Ruhl and I have just finished my Master thesis on the [Autodesk Stingray Engine](http://www.autodesk.com/products/stingray/overview), and now I'm looking for work in the games industry.

This site will be my attempt to give back to the community for all the tutorials I have read.

I hope you can find anything interesting and please contact me if you have any questions.

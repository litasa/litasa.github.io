## Bit encoding ##

So my first post is going to be about something I dabbled with in my master's thesis, bit encoding. Before I talk about the specific encoding I used, let me discuss some of the uses of encoding, and of course a small section on what encoding is.

#### So what is encoding? ####
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding), encoding (or code) is a system of rules to convert information. One encoding system that almost everyone have heard of is  [morse code](http://morsecode.scphillips.com/morse.html). Morse code is a system of rules that encodes and decodes the alphabet into sound or light signals. Encoding here means, for examlpe, going from the letter A to morse ( short long ), and decoding is the reverse, translating from morse (short long) to the lettar A. Basically you are translating data from one form into another.   

#### Why is it useful? ####
In order to answer this question let's take a look at an illustrative example. Concider the following, how many bits do a 64 bit unsigned integer use to represent the value 2?

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
uint64_t example = 2;
{% endhighlight %}

The example variable will be stored in memory as:

{% highlight cpp %}
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010
{% endhighlight %}

That is a lot of leading zeroes, containing no relevant information. 62 bits of it to be exact.

#### Designing the algorithm #####
Following the previous example one observation that can be made here is that most 64 bit values will likely not use all 64 bits. And if we are trying to reduce the amount bits used, let's just take the bits that matter, giving the following encoded bits:

{% highlight cpp %}
10
{% endhighlight %}

There is at least one major problem with this approach. When decoding `10` we will not know if have `1` followed by `0` or it is `2`. If we had even more values it would be very hard to know where one value ended and another one starts. So in order to enable decoding we need a delimitor. Let one bit in every byte be a flag to indicate if the current value is longer0(`0`) or not(`1`). Our previous example will then be encoded as 

{% highlight cpp %}
10000010
{% endhighlight %}

and saving us the need to store/transmit 56(!) bits of worthless information.

Let's have a more interesting example. What if we were to encode the value `300`, which would be stored in memory as: 

{% highlight cpp %}
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000001 00101100
{% endhighlight %}

We start by looking at the lower 7 bits (remember one bit for information, so only 7 bits of real value), and add a 0 to indicate that we have more information comming.

{% highlight cpp %}
00101100
{% endhighlight %}

In order to progress we need to remove this information from `300` and we do this by a [logical shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_shift) to the right with 7 bits,

{% highlight cpp %}
300 >> 7 = 2
{% endhighlight %}

And we know from before that `2` is encoded to

{% highlight cpp %}
10000010
{% endhighlight %}

So the value `300` is encoded to

{% highlight cpp %}
00101100 10000010
{% endhighlight %}

Did you notice that the bytes are in reverse order?

Depending on the scheme used for encoding the result will vary, the scheme I will introduce will encode the result to just 8 bits, instead of 64. So let's take a look at the algorithm.

#### The encoding #####
```cpp
uint8_t* encode(uint64_t value) {
  uint8_t* out[10];
  int i = 0;
  do {
    out[i++] = (uint8_t)(value & 0x7F);
    value >>= 7;
  } while(value);
  out[i - 1] |= 0x80;
  return out;
}
```

We will talk about what all the different pieces does in a bit, but first a high level overview.

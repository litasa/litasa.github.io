## Bit encoding ##

So my first post is going to be about something I did in my master's thesis, bit encoding. Before I talk about the specific encoding I used, let me discuss some of the uses of encoding, and of course a small section on what encoding is.

### So what is encoding? ###
I'm glad you asked. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding) defines encoding (or code) as a system of rules to convert information. So [morse code](http://morsecode.scphillips.com/morse.html) is a system of rules that encodes and decodes the alphabet into sound or light signals. Encoding here means, for examlpe, going from the letter A to morse ( short long ), and decoding is the reverse, translating from morse (short long) to the lettar A. Basically you are translating data from one form into another.

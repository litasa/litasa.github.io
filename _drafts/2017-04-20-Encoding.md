## Bit encoding ##

So my first post is going to be about something I dabbled with in my master's thesis, bit encoding. Before I talk about the specific encoding I used, let me discuss some of the uses of encoding, and of course a small section on what encoding is.

#### So what is encoding? ####
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding), encoding (or code) is a system of rules to convert information. One encoding system that almost everyone have heard of is  [morse code](http://morsecode.scphillips.com/morse.html). Morse code is a system of rules that encodes and decodes the alphabet into sound or light signals. Encoding here means, for examlpe, going from the letter A to morse ( short long ), and decoding is the reverse, translating from morse (short long) to the lettar A. Basically you are translating data from one form into another.   

#### Why is it useful? ####
In order to answer this question let's take a look at an illustrative example. Concider the following, how many bits do a 64 bit unsigned integer use to represent the value 1?
```c++
uint64_t example = 1;
```
The example variable will be stored in memory as:
```
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
```
That is a lot of memory containing no information. 63 bits of it. Depending on the scheme used for encoding the result will vary, the scheme I will introduce will encode the result to just 8 bits, instead of 64. So let's take a look at the algorithm.

#### The encoding #####

```c++
uint8_t* encode(uint64_t value) {
  uint8_t* out[10];
  int i = 0;
  do {
    out[i++] = (uint8_t)(value & 0x7F);
    value >>= 7;
  } while(value);
  out[i - 1] |= 0x80;
  return out;
}
```
We will talk about what all the different pieces does in a bit, but first a high level overview.

What we are trying to do is reduce the amount bits used for a 64 bit unsigned integer, for storage or transfere over the network in a fast and efficient way. The encoding is based on the observation that many 64 bit values don't use all 64 bits. So what if we only take the information that matters and discard the rest?
